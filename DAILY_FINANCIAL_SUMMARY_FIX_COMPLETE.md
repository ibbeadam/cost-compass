# âœ… Daily Financial Summary Calculations Fixed

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Resolved**

The Daily Financial Summary actual cost calculations are now working perfectly! 

### **Problem Identified**
1. **Property Context Mismatch**: Food and Beverage cost entries had `propertyId: null`, but Daily Financial Summaries had `propertyId: 1`
2. **Calculation Logic**: The calculation function was only looking for cost entries with matching propertyId, so null entries weren't being found
3. **Result**: Only adjustment values (entertainment, complimentary, other) were being calculated, giving negative or incorrect totals

### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Fixed Existing Data**: Updated all existing cost entries to have correct propertyId
2. **Enhanced Calculation Logic**: Added fallback to include both exact propertyId matches and null propertyId entries
3. **Added Debug Logging**: Better visibility into calculation process
4. **Verified Results**: All calculations now working correctly

## âœ… **Verification Results**

### **Current State (Working Perfectly)**
```
Date: 2025-07-01 | Property: Main Restaurant
Revenue - Food: $5000, Beverage: $2000
Actual Cost - Food: $1820, Beverage: $480
Cost % - Food: 36.40%, Beverage: 24.00%
Variance - Food: 6.40%, Beverage: -1.00%

Cost Entries - Food: $1950 (1 entries), Beverage: $560 (1 entries)
Expected - Food: $1820, Beverage: $480

Calculation Breakdown:
Food: $1950 - $100 (ent) - $50 (co) + $20 (other) = $1820 âœ…
Beverage: $560 - $60 (ent) - $30 (co) + $10 (other) = $480 âœ…
```

### **Calculation Formula (Working Correctly)**
```
Actual Food Cost = Total Food Cost Entries - Entertainment Food - Complimentary Food + Other Food Adjustments
Actual Beverage Cost = Total Beverage Cost Entries - Entertainment Beverage - Complimentary Beverage + Other Beverage Adjustments

Food Cost % = (Actual Food Cost / Actual Food Revenue) Ã— 100
Beverage Cost % = (Actual Beverage Cost / Actual Beverage Revenue) Ã— 100

Food Variance % = Actual Food Cost % - Budget Food Cost %
Beverage Variance % = Actual Beverage Cost % - Budget Beverage Cost %
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Fixes Applied**

### **1. Data Migration Script** âœ…
- **File**: `/scripts/fix-cost-entries.js`
- **Action**: Updated all existing food and beverage cost entries to have correct propertyId
- **Result**: 1 food cost entry and 1 beverage cost entry updated

### **2. Enhanced Calculation Logic** âœ…
- **File**: `/src/actions/dailyFinancialSummaryActions.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Added OR clause to find cost entries with both exact propertyId match AND null propertyId (for backward compatibility)
- **Added**: Debug logging for better transparency

### **3. Property Context Integration** âœ…
- **Food Cost Actions**: Now automatically assign propertyId from outlet relationship
- **Beverage Cost Actions**: Now automatically assign propertyId from outlet relationship
- **Daily Financial Actions**: Smart property detection with fallbacks
